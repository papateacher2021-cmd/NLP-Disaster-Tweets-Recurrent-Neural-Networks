# NLP with Disaster Tweets - Recurrent Neural Network Model
This repository contains my submission for the Kaggle "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.
This exercise is an introduction to Natural Language Processing, about text binary classification problem using RNN.
This is just an exercise for peer assessment, as requested by the University of Colorado Boulder under Deep Learning Course Module #4: DL on Sequential Data.

## Results
- **Kaggle Score:** 0.80079
- **Leaderboard Rank:** #272
- **Model:** Architecture RNN using Embedded Layer (to implement Stanford University's GloVe - Thanks a lot to Stanford!) and Bidirectional LSTM layers.
